#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gather-remarkable-health.sh — heartbeat gather: is the reMarkable
# OTA pipeline reachable?
#
# Emits JSON gather-contract on stdout:
#   {"count": 0, "status": "healthy", "items": N, "checked_at": "..."}
#     → no alert needed (rmapi auth + cloud reachable, tablet visible)
#   {"count": 1, "status": "<failure tag>", "detail": "...", "checked_at": "..."}
#     → fires the alert prompt
#
# What's checked:
#   1. rmapi binary exists + executable
#   2. ~/.rmapi config exists + has a devicetoken
#   3. `rmapi ls /` returns OK (auth refresh still works, cloud reachable)
#   4. Tablet last-sync state — we infer from the # of items at root
#      (>0 = tablet has been syncing; 0 = either empty or auth-broken)
#
# Failure tags surface in the alert prompt so claude can route the
# response (re-pair runbook vs network-debug etc.).
#
# This heartbeat ALSO catches the silent-fail mode that surfaced
# 2026-05-25: rmapi config had devicetoken but empty usertoken, every
# call returned 400, no other heartbeat noticed until the installer asked
# directly. With this gather wired into the heartbeat dispatcher the
# next occurrence fires a #<devops> alert within the heartbeat
# cadence (default daily).
