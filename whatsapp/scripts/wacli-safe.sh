# wacli-safe.sh — privacy-enforced wrapper around wacli (#119, #384).
#
# Rationale (installer directive, reference install 2026-04-30):
#   "WhatsApp 1-on-1 messages have an expectation of privacy that I'm violating
#    by virtue of having you with access to read everything... can you establish
#    some guardrails that prevent you from reading direct WhatsApp messages and
#    only read the groups?"
#
# Enforcement:
#   1. Only `wacli messages list` and `wacli messages search` are routed through;
#      all other subcommands are passed through unchanged (chats list, contacts,
#      groups, doctor, version, etc. — these are metadata, not message content).
#   2. Any --chat / --from filter MUST resolve to a JID present in the allowlist
#      groups[] array of data/whatsapp-allowlist.json.
#   3. Any unfiltered `messages list` or `messages search` is REJECTED — the
#      wrapper requires an explicit allowlisted --chat. (Otherwise it would
#      bleed DMs into output.)
#   4. Wildcards / regex / multi-JID filters are NOT supported — one allowlisted
#      JID per call.
#
# Usage (drop-in for read paths):
#   wacli-safe.sh messages list --chat 120363397436589829@g.us --limit 50
#   wacli-safe.sh messages search "community" --chat 120363397436589829@g.us
#   wacli-safe.sh chats list --json                # passes through (metadata only)
#   wacli-safe.sh groups list                      # passes through
#
# Anything outside this wrapper (raw `wacli messages ...` calls) is blocked at
# the .claude/hooks/guardrails.sh layer — see that file for the second-line defense.
