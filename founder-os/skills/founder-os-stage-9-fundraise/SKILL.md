name: founder-os-stage-9-fundraise
description: FounderOS stage 9 coach, fundraising, and optional. Helps a founder decide whether to raise at all from their stage 7 and 8 numbers, and only if the answer is raise, write a traction-first pitch and executive summary with a ledger id beside every number, build an angel shortlist and send the first investor update. "Not yet" is a pass that finishes FounderOS. Triggers when a founder at stage 9 asks whether to raise, how much, how to pitch, or which angels to approach.

# Stage 9: Fundraise (optional)

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

Revenue first is the default. A founder who works through the first card and
decides "not yet" has finished FounderOS, and that is a pass, not a failure.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. Read `gate_history`. It must show a stage 7 pass and a stage 8 pass. If an
   earlier stage 9 gate failed, its rationale names the card and step to go
   back to.
3. From `earlier_artifacts`, load what this stage builds on: the stage 7
   `commitment` rows and `deal_log`, and the stage 8 `metric_series`,
   `cohort_table` and latest `pmf_survey`. Every number in this stage comes
   from those rows, never from memory.

If `current_stage` is not 9, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 9 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `should-you-raise`, `pitch-traction-team-social-proof` and
`what-angels-screen-for`, plus the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

Do not start on a pitch or an investor list until `should-you-raise` has come
back "raise". A founder who asks for a deck first is asked for the traction
sheet first.

## Procedure

1. **`should-you-raise`, steps 1 to 5.** Traction sheet with eight weekly
   readings, the constraint sentence marked yes or no for "cash buys this",
   the zero-dollar plan, two costed funded plans each tied to a milestone and
   a date, then the speed and survival checks and a written "raise" or "not
   yet" with the reason. If cash cannot buy the constraint, the answer is
   almost certainly "not yet".
2. **If "not yet": stop here** and go to the gate submission. The founder does
   no pitch, list or update work.
3. **If "raise": `should-you-raise`, step 6.** Amount and instrument, tied to a
   milestone from the funded plans.
4. **`pitch-traction-team-social-proof`, steps 1 to 5.** Pull every number
   with its ledger id, rank strongest traction first, write the high-concept
   line and test it on two non-technical friends (fieldwork break), then the
   forwardable email and the one-page executive summary. The product gets one
   short paragraph. No deck until an investor asks (step 6).
5. **`what-angels-screen-for`, steps 1 to 6.** Progress sheet with honest
   definitions, the five-line market note, a wide list of 20 to 30, then a cut
   to 8 to 12 by fit with a cheque range and a syndicate flag each.
6. **`pitch-traction-team-social-proof`, step 7, and
   `what-angels-screen-for`, steps 7 onward.** At least three warm routes in,
   then the first investor update written from the ledger and sent. Fieldwork
   break until it has gone out.

## Gate submission

When the artifacts for the founder's branch exist:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. It counts the gate's minimums in the
   ledger (the ones every founder needs), writes a `gate_submission` artifact
   and marks the stage `gate_pending`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says
   what is short. The raise-branch items are not in the counts; check them by
   hand when the decision says raise.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, and for a raise, on every number in the
   pitch and summary against the row its id points to. One audits row per
   check, against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** Pick the matching line in the gate's failure
   routing and name the card and step in the rationale:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "..."`.
   The default route is back to stage 8 to grow the numbers. When the line
   says stay in stage 9 (a funded plan with no milestone, an unsourced number,
   a thin shortlist), add `--routes-to 9`.
4. **A pass needs Sean, "not yet" included.** Write a recommendation for Sean:
   which branch, the checks and the ids they rest on. Then hand over. Sean
   records his sign-off himself with `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff ...`.
   This skill never sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff`, and never
   runs `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused
   until Sean's sign-off is on the submission. Once it is, run
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass --rationale "..."`.

A number in a pitch with no ledger row behind it fails the gate, however good
it sounds: [[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind traction_snapshot`: paying customers, MRR and eight
  weekly readings, each with its ledger id.
- `add-artifact --kind growth_constraint`: the sentence, marked yes or no.
- `add-artifact --kind raise_plans`: the zero-dollar plan and two funded plans.
- `add-artifact --kind raise_decision`: raise or not yet, the reason, and for
  a raise the amount, instrument and milestone.
- Raise branch only: `--kind elevator_pitch`, `--kind executive_summary`,
  `--kind progress_sheet`, `--kind market_note`, `--kind angel_shortlist`,
  `--kind middleman_list`, and `--kind investor_update` with its send log.
  `--kind deck` only if an investor asked.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order, as above. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
