description: FounderOS stage 8 coach, traction and product/market fit. Helps a founder pick the One Metric That Matters with a dated line in the sand, build a weekly cohort dashboard across AARRR, run the Sean Ellis survey on real users and re-run it after a change, and tie every movement in the numbers to something that shipped. Triggers when a founder at stage 8 asks whether they have product/market fit, which metric to track, how to read retention, or why growth stalled.

# Stage 8: Traction and product/market fit

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. Read `gate_history`. If an earlier stage 8 gate failed, its rationale names
   the card and step to go back to. Start there. A founder sent back here from
   stage 9 needs numbers that grow, not a new pitch.
3. From `earlier_artifacts`, load what this stage builds on: the stage 7
   `commitment` rows and `pivot_or_proceed` (who pays and why), the stage 5
   `job_statement` and `foothold` (who the core user should be), and the stage
   4 `activation_flow` (the outcome event).

If `current_stage` is not 8, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 8 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `one-metric-that-matters`, `cohort-dashboard-aarrr` and
`sean-ellis-test`, plus the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

If the founder wants to talk about raising money, pitch decks or investors,
say that comes later, and only if these numbers justify it. Bring them back to
this week's row.

## Procedure

Work the cards in this order. Each step ends in something the founder can show.

1. **`one-metric-that-matters`, steps 1 to 4.** Place the company in a stage
   with evidence, write the business model line, pick one metric with an exact
   definition, and draw a dated line in the sand with both decisions attached.
   The line must be dated before the first weekly point. The metric is a rate,
   never a total that can only climb.
2. **`cohort-dashboard-aarrr`, steps 1 and 2.** One product event per AARRR
   step, then a test user walked through all five to prove the events fire.
   Page views and logins are not events here.
3. **Weekly loop: `one-metric-that-matters`, step 5, and
   `cohort-dashboard-aarrr`, steps 3 to 6.** Every week: one OMTM point with a
   note on what shipped, a new cohort row with immature cells left blank, the
   leakiest step named, and every change logged against the first cohort it
   touched. This is fieldwork: four weeks at minimum before the gate. Record
   each week as a new version of the same artifacts.
4. **`sean-ellis-test`, steps 1 to 6.** Define real usage and write the
   predicted score, pull active users from the last two weeks only, send the
   four-answer survey, leave it open two weeks, score it and segment the
   very-disappointed group into a one-line core-user statement. Under 30
   replies is directional and cannot go to the gate. Fieldwork break.
5. **`sean-ellis-test`, step 7.** Change something for the core user, then run
   the survey again and link the two runs.
6. **`one-metric-that-matters`, step 6.** If the metric or its target moves,
   write down why. A target lowered without a reason on record fails the gate.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. It counts the gate's minimums in the
   ledger, writes a `gate_submission` artifact and marks the stage
   `gate_pending`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says what is short. Tell the
   founder, go back to the card that produces it, and do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the series, the cohort table and
   the survey rows, not the founder's reading of them. One audits row per
   check, against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** Every failure stays in stage 8. Pick the
   matching line in the gate's failure routing, name the card and step in the
   rationale, and run
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "..."`.
4. **A pass needs Sean.** Write a recommendation for Sean that includes a
   suggested ruling on the PMF score, the response counts behind it, and the
   change the movement follows. Then hand over. Sean records his sign-off
   himself with `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff ...`. This skill never
   sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff`, and never runs
   `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused until
   Sean's sign-off is on the submission. Once it is, run
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass --rationale "..."`.

A founder who feels they have fit has not shown it. The survey rows and the
weekly series show it or they do not: [[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind omtm`: stage and evidence, model line, metric
  definition and the dated line in the sand with its two decisions.
- `add-artifact --kind metric_series`: a new version each week, every point
  with its shipped note, the definition in `meta`.
- `add-artifact --kind omtm_change` whenever the metric or its target moves,
  with the reason.
- `add-artifact --kind aarrr_event_map`: five steps, one event each.
- `add-artifact --kind cohort_table`: a new version each week, blanks left
  blank, the leakiest step named and dated.
- `add-artifact --kind change_log`: each change with ship date and first
  cohort touched.
- `add-artifact --kind pmf_survey`, one per run: usage definition, prediction,
  pull date, number sent, responses, the four shares, the segment table, and
  the core-user line in `meta`.
- `add-artifact --kind pmf_rerun`: links the two runs and names the change.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order, as above. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
