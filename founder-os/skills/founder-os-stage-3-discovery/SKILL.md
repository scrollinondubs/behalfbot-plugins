description: FounderOS stage 3 coach, customer discovery. Walks a founder through problem interviews built on questions that could sink the idea, audits every interview line by line, grades each close by what it cost the interviewee, and qualifies earlyvangelists from interview evidence. Triggers when a founder at stage 3 asks how to run customer interviews, who to talk to, whether an interview went well, or who their early adopters are, and after a stage 2 pass.

# Stage 3: Discovery

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. From `earlier_artifacts`, read the stage 2 `jobs` and `problem_hypothesis`
   (the problems the interviews test), and the stage 1 `audience` with its
   `bowling_pin` (who to book). The stage 0 `riskiest_assumption` often
   supplies the question that could sink the idea.
3. Check `counts.interviews` and `this_stage_artifacts`. A founder mid-stage
   already has a script and some records; pick up from the last tally.
4. Read `gate_history`. A failed stage 3 gate names the card and step.

If `current_stage` is not 3, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 3 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `interviews-without-fooling-yourself`,
`problem-interview-exit-criteria` and `earlyvangelists-and-commitment`, plus
the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

No demos, no prototypes, no pricing asks. If the founder wants to show their
app in a call, say that is stage 4. Asking for money is stage 7; a deposit
offered unprompted is recorded, never requested.

## Procedure

1. **`interviews-without-fooling-yourself`, steps 1 and 2.** Write three to
   five questions that could sink the plan, then rewrite each about the
   recent past. Save the list as the first `big_questions` version.
2. **`problem-interview-exit-criteria`, steps 1 to 7.** Draft the call script
   together: opening, segment facts, problem story, ranking, workaround dig,
   closing ask. Then send the founder to book and run calls from the stage 1
   pin. This is fieldwork: end the session here.
3. **Per interview, within a day (`interviews-without-fooling-yourself` steps
   3 to 7, `problem-interview-exit-criteria` step 8).** The founder brings the
   transcript or notes as `Speaker: text` lines, pseudonymous. In this order:
   a. Save the text to a file and run the `founder-os-mom-test-auditor`
      skill's audit from the file (`audit.py mom-test --input <file> --founder "<label>" --lang <..>`)
      and write its report. Only facts survive: [[past-behaviour-not-opinions]].
   b. Run the `founder-os-earlyvangelist-qualifier` skill from the same file
      (`audit.py earlyvangelist --input <file> --transcript ...`) and grade the
      close by `earlyvangelists-and-commitment` steps 2 to 4. A
      [[commitment-signal]] names what the step cost them.
   c. Write the row once: `stage.py add-interview` with `--commitment` from
      the grade, and `--earlyvangelist` only on five of five criteria with
      evidence and Sean's confirmation of the escalation. The row cannot be
      edited later, so if Sean has not confirmed yet, wait to write it.
   d. Re-run both auditors with `--interview-id <id> --record` so labels hang
      on the row, and write each skill's claude `audits` row
      (`--check mom_test`, `--check earlyvangelist`).
   e. `add-pain` only for lines that survived the audit as facts.
4. **`problem-interview-exit-criteria`, step 9, weekly.** A `problem_tally`
   per batch, script changes logged in `meta`.
5. **`problem-interview-exit-criteria`, step 10.** The three-line
   `exit_criteria` statement, each line linked to interview ids. A blank line
   means another batch.
6. **`earlyvangelists-and-commitment`, steps 5 and 6.** Cross-check flags
   against commitment grades, then write the [[earlyvangelist]] list. Update
   `big_questions` with which interviews answered what.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says
   what is short. Tell the founder, go back to the card that produces it, and
   do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the interview rows and their
   audits. Spot-check at least three interviews line by line yourself. One
   audits row per check against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** Decide it straight away:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "<checks and ids>"`.
   It routes to stage 3 by default and the rationale names the card and step.
   If interviewees did not recognise the problem at all, add `--routes-to 2`.
4. **A pass needs Sean.** Write a recommendation for Sean: the verdict, the
   interview, audit and artifact ids it rests on, and any borderline. Hand
   over to him and stop. Sean records his sign-off himself with
   `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff --founder-id <id> --verdict pass|fail --findings "..."`.
   This skill never sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff` and never
   runs `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused
   until Sean's sign-off is on the submission; once it is, run
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass --rationale "..."`.

Warm calls are not evidence. Only audited rows count:
[[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py` and the two auditors, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind big_questions`: the question list, then new versions as
  interviews answer them, citing interview ids.
- `add-interview --interviewee <pseudonym> --notes-file ... --conducted-on ... --segment ... --commitment ... [--earlyvangelist]`,
  once per call, after the file-based audits (step 3).
- Labels and claude `audits` rows per interview, from the auditor skills.
- `add-pain` for surviving facts only.
- `add-artifact --kind problem_tally` per batch; `--kind exit_criteria`;
  `--kind earlyvangelists` with the list and mismatch notes.
- `submit`, the check rulings, then `decide`. Never `record_gate_decision`
  directly, and never Sean's rows.
