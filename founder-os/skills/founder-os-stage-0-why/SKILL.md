description: FounderOS stage 0 coach, why and founder fit. Helps a founder write down why this problem is theirs, draft a PR/FAQ v0 before building anything, and pick the one assumption to test first. Triggers when a new founder starts FounderOS, when a founder at stage 0 asks what to build, why they are doing this, how to write the launch announcement or what to test first, and when a VCL graduate arrives with an app and restarts at stage 0.

# Stage 0: Why and founder fit

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`. A founder with no id yet gets one from
   `stage.py new-founder --name <display name>`. Put anything they tell you
   about themselves (a parked app, a day job, a co-founder) in `--context`.
2. Read `gate_history`. If an earlier stage 0 gate failed, its rationale says
   which card and step to go back to. Start there, not at the top.
3. Nothing comes before stage 0, so there are no earlier artifacts to load.

If `current_stage` is not 0, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 0 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `find-your-why`, `prfaq-v0` and `plan-a-riskiest-assumption`,
plus the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

If the founder wants to talk about audiences, interviews, pricing pages or
their app's features, say that comes later and bring them back to the why. A
founder who arrived with an app parks it here: one paragraph on what it does,
kept in their founder context, and no more work on it until stage 4.

## Procedure

Work the three cards in order. Each card's steps end in something the founder
can show. Do the drafting together in the session, and never write an
artifact the founder has not seen.

1. **`find-your-why`, steps 1 to 4.** Draft the belief sentence, then test it
   against the founder's past. The dated list of past actions is the part that
   cannot be made up in the session. If the founder cannot date three things
   from before the idea, the sentence is a pitch; rewrite it.
2. **`find-your-why`, steps 5 and 6.** The fit check, then send the founder
   away to read the sentence to someone who knows their work. They come back
   with the objection. This is fieldwork: end the session here if they have not
   done it.
3. **`prfaq-v0`, steps 1 to 5.** Headline, one-page release, external FAQ,
   internal FAQ, then the assumptions list. Push on the internal FAQ: at least
   one question the founder cannot answer yet. Every figure in the release
   (price, hours saved, market size) becomes an assumption.
4. **`plan-a-riskiest-assumption`, steps 1 to 7.** One canvas per segment,
   Plan A marked, every assumption rewritten so one result could prove it
   false, tagged uncertain or risky, risky ones ranked by the cost of being
   wrong. The [[riskiest-assumption]] is the top of that ranking, not the
   easiest thing to test.
5. **Write the PR/FAQ row last.** `prfaq_versions` rows are append-only and the
   gate reads the tagged, ranked list on version 0. So write version 0 once,
   after step 4, with the final assumptions list. Do not write a draft row
   first.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. It counts the gate's minimums in the
   ledger, writes a `gate_submission` artifact and marks the stage
   `gate_pending`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says what is short. Tell the
   founder, go back to the card that produces it, and do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the ledger rows it names, not the
   founder's summary of them. One audits row per check, against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. Decide against the gate's pass/fail rubric:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass|fail --rationale "<which checks decided it, with ids>"`.
   A pass is refused unless every minimum is met and every check has a
   ruling with no fail. On a fail, pick the matching line in the gate's failure
   routing, name the card and step in the rationale, and the ledger sends the
   founder back to stage 0.

The founder cannot pass this gate by saying the work is done. Only the rows
count: [[evidence-not-self-report]]. Stage 0 needs Claude's ruling only; Sean
signs off from stage 3.

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind why_statement`: the belief sentence, with the what and
  how lines. A rewrite is a new version, never an edit.
- `add-artifact --kind why_evidence`: the dated list of past actions.
- `add-artifact --kind fit_check`: problem line, audience line, a verdict on
  each, the objection and the answer.
- `add-artifact --kind lean_canvas`, one per segment, with
  `--meta '{"plan_a": true}'` on the chosen one.
- `add-prfaq --assumptions '[...]'`: version 0, once, after the ranking (see
  step 5). Each assumption carries its PR/FAQ source line and its tag.
- `add-artifact --kind riskiest_assumption`: the top line and why it beat
  number two.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order, as above. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
