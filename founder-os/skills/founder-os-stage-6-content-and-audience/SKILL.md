description: FounderOS stage 6 coach, content and audience. Helps a founder publish e-bombs that fix one logged pain each, grow a list that actually replies, write a Pain-Dream-Fix sales page from sourced quotes, and pick one traction channel with Bullseye. Triggers when a founder at stage 6 asks what to write, how to grow a list, how to write the sales page, which marketing channel to use, or why nobody signs up.

# Stage 6: Content and audience

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. Read `gate_history`. If an earlier stage 6 gate failed, its rationale names
   the card and step to go back to. Start there.
3. From `earlier_artifacts`, load what this stage builds on: the stage 1
   `watering_holes` list, the stage 2 `jobs` artifact, and the stage 5
   `job_statement` and `foothold`. The pain log itself is the `pains` table;
   `counts.pains` says how big it is.

If `current_stage` is not 6, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 6 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `e-bombs`, `pain-dream-fix` and `bullseye-one-channel`, plus
the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

If the founder wants to talk about pricing calls, sales outreach or growth
dashboards, say that comes later and bring them back to the content. Asking a
person for money is stage 7; measuring retention is stage 8.

## Procedure

Work the cards in this order. Each step ends in something the founder can show.

1. **`e-bombs`, steps 1 to 4.** Pick a pain by headcount across unrelated
   threads, not by volume. One-line promise, the fix written in the logged
   quotes' own words, then a one-person test. If no pain in the log has three
   distinct sources, stop: the log is thin, and that is a stage 2 problem.
2. **Audit the draft.** Save it as an `ebomb` artifact, then run the
   `founder-os-pain-dream-fix-checker` skill on it
   (`audit.py pain-dream-fix --founder-id <id> --artifact-id <artifact_id> --lang <lang> --record`).
   An e-bomb that mentions the product before the fix is done fails here.
3. **`e-bombs`, steps 5 to 8.** Publish, answer inside the thread at each
   [[watering-hole]], invite onto the list, send to the list, then log the
   response a week later. This is fieldwork: end the session until the week
   has passed. Repeat steps 1 to 3 until four e-bombs are live, and keep the
   content wall current.
4. **`pain-dream-fix`, steps 1 to 5.** Five to eight pain lines, every one
   with a `pains` id, then dreams, then the fix and the offer. Save the page as
   a `sales_page` artifact and run the pain-dream-fix checker on it. Every
   paragraph needs exactly one tag and no pain line without a source.
5. **`pain-dream-fix`, steps 6 and 7.** Send to a segment of 50 to 200
   subscribers before the page goes live, then revise and publish. The segment
   test date must come before the publish date. Fieldwork break.
6. **`bullseye-one-channel`, steps 1 to 4.** Traction goal and critical path,
   the full channel sheet, the rings, the inner ring.
7. **`bullseye-one-channel`, steps 5 and 6.** Write each test's pass mark
   before it starts, run the tests, then choose one channel. A pass mark set
   after the results came in is not a pass mark. Fieldwork break.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. It counts the gate's minimums in the
   ledger, writes a `gate_submission` artifact and marks the stage
   `gate_pending`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says what is short. Tell the
   founder, go back to the card that produces it, and do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the ledger rows and the live URLs,
   not the founder's summary. One audits row per check, against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** Pick the matching line in the gate's failure
   routing and name the card and step in the rationale:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "..."`.
   When the line says back to stage 2 (no quoted pain behind an e-bomb, or a
   thin pain log), add `--routes-to 2`. Otherwise the founder stays in stage 6.
4. **A pass needs Sean.** Write a short recommendation for Sean: the checks,
   the ids they rest on, and any borderline call. Then hand over. Sean records
   his sign-off himself with `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff ...`. This
   skill never sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff`, and never runs
   `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused until
   Sean's sign-off is on the submission. Once it is, run
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass --rationale "..."`.

A responsive list means replies, clicks or signups. Opens, views and
subscriber counts alone never pass this gate: [[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind ebomb`, one per piece: the `pains` id it serves, the
  one-line promise, the live URL and every watering-hole link. A revision is a
  new version, never an edit.
- `add-artifact --kind content_wall`: the index page URL and every e-bomb and
  the sales page on it.
- `add-artifact --kind email_list`: weekly counts and the signup source of
  each subscriber.
- `add-artifact --kind response_log`: one row per e-bomb with replies,
  signups, shares and questions.
- `add-artifact --kind sales_page`: URL, version number and the paragraph tag
  map from the checker.
- `add-artifact --kind segment_test`: segment, size, send date and results.
- `add-artifact --kind traction_goal`, `--kind channel_brainstorm`, one
  `--kind channel_test` per test, and `--kind chosen_channel`.
- `add-pain` for each new question readers or testers raise, with the reply or
  comment as the source.
- The checker's labels and its `audits` row on each e-bomb and the sales page.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order, as above. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
