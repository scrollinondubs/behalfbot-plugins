description: FounderOS stage 4 coach, solution test. Helps a founder pick the MVP type that tests their riskiest assumption, run a five-day Sprint that reshapes their existing app into a prototype tested with stage 3 earlyvangelists, then run priced solution interviews and cut the MVP to what was proven. Triggers when a founder at stage 4 asks what to build first, how to test their app with customers, what to charge in a demo, or which features to keep, and after a stage 3 pass. This is where a parked VCL app comes back.

# Stage 4: Solution test

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. From `earlier_artifacts`, read the stage 0 `riskiest_assumption` and the
   ranked assumptions on `latest_prfaq`, the stage 3 `earlyvangelists` list
   and `exit_criteria`, and the stage 1 `parked_idea` if there is one. The app
   comes back here, as raw material for a prototype, not as the answer.
3. Read `gate_history`. A failed stage 4 gate names the card and step.

If `current_stage` is not 4, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 4 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `choose-the-mvp-type`, `sprint-test-your-app` and
`solution-interview-reduce-mvp`, plus the concept notes they link. Nothing
else.

Positioning, launch copy, channels and sales pipelines come later. The price in
this stage is a stated figure in a demo, not a sales campaign.

## Procedure

1. **`choose-the-mvp-type`, steps 1 to 5.** Take the top untested
   [[riskiest-assumption]], make it one yes/no question about what customers
   do, match it to a type, list the reshaping, pick 5 to 15 test customers,
   and fix numeric pass and fail lines with a deadline. Save `mvp_choice`
   before any session is booked; the gate checks it predates the Sprint.
2. **`sprint-test-your-app`, steps 1 to 5.** Decider, sprint questions each
   citing a stage 3 interview id, the customer map, rival sketches and the
   keep/change/cut mark on every existing screen.
3. **`sprint-test-your-app`, step 6.** The founder reshapes the app on a
   throwaway branch. Fieldwork: end the session here.
4. **`sprint-test-your-app`, steps 7 and 8.** Five sessions, one at a time,
   each with a stage 3 [[earlyvangelist]] (an `interviews` row with
   `earlyvangelist` set; `stage.py rows --table interviews --earlyvangelist`
   lists them). Actions, not opinions, and no rescuing. Then the
   grid: a finding needs three of five testers.
5. **`solution-interview-reduce-mvp`, steps 1 to 4.** Ten solution
   interviews, mostly people already in the ledger, each ending on a stated
   price and a logged reaction. Fieldwork.
6. **`solution-interview-reduce-mvp`, step 5.** Freeze the demo for a week,
   then score the four exit criteria.
7. **`solution-interview-reduce-mvp`, steps 6 and 7.** Cut the app: every
   kept feature cites a must-have tag, at least one is deleted or backlogged,
   and removed features are gone from the build. Then the activation flow to
   the first outcome event, checked on a fresh account.
8. **Report against the lines set in step 1.** If a result lands between pass
   and fail, `choose-the-mvp-type` allows one rerun.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says
   what is short. Tell the founder, go back to the card that produces it, and
   do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the rows. Compare `created_at` of
   the first `mvp_choice` with the first session date. One audits row per
   check against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "<checks, ids, card and step>"`.
   Every routing line in this gate stays in stage 4. If fewer than five
   earlyvangelists exist from stage 3, do not route back yourself: flag it to
   Sean, who decides whether to reopen stage 3.
4. **A pass needs Sean.** Write a recommendation with the ids the rubric asks
   for and every borderline (Sean rules on each). Hand over and stop. Sean
   records his sign-off himself with
   `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff --founder-id <id> --verdict pass|fail --findings "..."`.
   This skill never sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff` and never
   runs `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused
   until Sean's sign-off is on the submission.

An app that looks the same after the test fails the gate, however many
sessions ran: [[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind mvp_choice`: assumption, question, type, reshaping,
  test customers, pass line, fail line, deadline. Mark the assumption "under
  test" in its `meta`; the PR/FAQ row itself cannot be edited. Never revise the
  lines after the first session.
- `add-artifact` for `sprint_plan`, `sprint_sketches`, `prototype` (build link
  and reshape log) and `sprint_results`.
- `add-artifact --kind interview_record` per Sprint session, `meta` holding the
  tester's stage 3 `interviews` id.
- Per solution interview: `add-interview` (new people get a pseudonym) and
  `add-artifact --kind solution_interview` with feature tags, price response
  and the `interviews` id.
- `add-artifact` for `exit_criteria`, `mvp_scope` and `activation_flow`.
- `add-pain` only if a new must-have problem came up.
- `submit`, the check rulings, then `decide`. Never `record_gate_decision`
  directly, and never Sean's rows.
