# Coach: Paul Graham's essays

A coach skill. It works at any stage, it never blocks or passes a gate, and it
writes nothing to the gate record.

Send one essay, not a reading list. Link it, say in a line why it fits right
now, and let the founder read Graham in his own words. Do not summarise the
essays.

## Guardrails

- An essay supports the current stage; it never replaces the stage's work.
- Stage 9 essays go to stage 9 founders. A stage 3 founder who asks about
  fundraising gets pointed back to interviews.
