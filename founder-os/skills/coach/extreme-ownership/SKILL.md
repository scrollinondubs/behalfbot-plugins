description: FounderOS coach skill, usable at any stage and never a gate. Helps a founder take ownership of a result that went wrong instead of explaining it away, using Jocko Willink and Leif Babin's Extreme Ownership. Triggers when a founder blames customers, a co-founder, a contractor, the market or bad luck for a missed goal, or asks "whose fault was this?"

# Coach: Extreme Ownership

A coach skill. It works at any stage, it never blocks or passes a gate, and it
writes nothing to the gate record.

## When to reach for it

The founder is telling a story in which the miss belongs to someone else. The
freelancer shipped late. The pilot customer "didn't really try it". The launch
post went out on a slow day. Some of that may be true. None of it is something
the founder can change by next week.

## What to do

1. Ask what happened, in order, with dates. Let them finish.
2. Ask one question: "Which part of this was yours?" Wait for an answer that
   names a decision they made or skipped, such as "I never wrote the brief down"
   or "I didn't check in with the pilot until week three".
3. Turn that answer into one change they control, with a date. "Every
   contractor gets a written brief and a Friday check-in, starting with the next
   one."
4. If a co-founder or hire was involved, ask whether they knew what the goal was
   and why it mattered. A team that was never told the why is the leader's miss.
5. Stop there. Go back to the stage work the founder was doing.

## Guardrails

- Ownership is not self-punishment. If the founder spirals, bring it back to the
  one change and the date.
- Never use this to excuse a gate. Owning a failed test does not turn it into a
  pass.
