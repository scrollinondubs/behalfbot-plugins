description: FounderOS stage 2 coach, pain research. Walks a founder through a written problem hypothesis, Sales Safari sessions in their watering holes that log pains as verbatim linked quotes, saturation checks, and clustering the log into jobs. Triggers when a founder at stage 2 asks what their audience struggles with, how to research pain before talking to anyone, whether they have read enough, or how to group what they found, and after a stage 1 pass.

# Stage 2: Pain research

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. From `earlier_artifacts`, read the stage 1 `audience` (with its
   `bowling_pin` in `meta`) and `watering_holes`. Only places marked keep
   there are hunting grounds here, and the search sheet in its `meta` gives the
   audience's own terms.
3. Check `counts.pains` and `this_stage_artifacts`: a founder coming back
   mid-stage already has a hypothesis and some sessions. Pick up from the last
   `saturation_check`, not from the top.
4. Read `gate_history`. A failed stage 2 gate names the card and step.

If `current_stage` is not 2, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 2 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `problem-hypothesis-heard-enough`, `sales-safari-pain-log` and
`cluster-pains-into-jobs`, plus the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

Stage 2 is reading, not talking. No interviews, no polls, no posts in the
watering holes asking what people struggle with. If the founder wants to book
calls or sketch a product, say that comes later.

## Procedure

1. **`problem-hypothesis-heard-enough`, steps 1 and 2.** Write the hypothesis
   and its kill line before any reading, and save it. The gate checks that the
   first version predates the log.
2. **`sales-safari-pain-log`, steps 1 to 5, as fieldwork.** The founder runs
   45-minute sessions alone in one kept watering hole at a time. Show them the
   capture format once in the session: verbatim quote, permalink, post date,
   author handle, their words, worldview, what they buy, and a supports,
   contradicts or surprise tag against the hypothesis.
3. **Log as they go (`sales-safari-pain-log` step 6).** One `add-pain` per
   distinct pain, with everything from step 2 in `--tags`. Pains rows are
   written once, so get the tags right before writing.
4. **Pre-tag and audit every pain.** Run the `founder-os-pain-tagger` skill's
   pain-log check after each session:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/audit.py" pain-log --founder-id <id> --lang <en|pt|...> --record`,
   then follow that skill's Claude pass. Every `pains` row needs its own
   audits row (`record_audit.py --table pains --id <pain_id> --auditor claude --check pain_quality ...`);
   the gate counts audited rows, not raw rows. Before each session the founder
   can also run its `pain-tagger` ranking over pasted posts to read the
   painful ones first.
5. **`problem-hypothesis-heard-enough`, steps 4 to 7, every ten entries.** A
   `saturation_check` per batch of ten. Narrow the who if nothing forms after
   about twenty. If the kill line comes true, invalidate and rewrite; if the
   log shows the audience was the wrong group, that is a stage 1 failure.
6. **`sales-safari-pain-log` step 7.** Keep going until at least three
   watering holes and many authors are in the log and the stopping rule holds.
7. **`cluster-pains-into-jobs`, steps 1 to 7.** Read the log in one sitting,
   sort by situation, split mixed piles, fill in the three sides with quote
   ids, list current hires (doing nothing counts), write each
   [[job-to-be-done]] as one sentence, and assign every pain to a job or to
   `unclustered`.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says
   what is short. Tell the founder, go back to the card that produces it, and
   do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the rows. For the verbatim check,
   draw ten `pains` rows and open each `source_url` yourself. One audits row
   per check against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. Decide against the gate's pass/fail rubric:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass|fail --rationale "<which checks decided it, with ids>"`.
   Most failures stay in stage 2 and the rationale names the card and step.
   If the log shows the audience was the wrong group, fail with
   `--routes-to 1`.

Paraphrased quotes, or quotes the founder remembers but did not link, are not
evidence: [[evidence-not-self-report]]. Stage 2 needs Claude's ruling only;
Sean signs off from stage 3.

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py` and the pain tagger, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind problem_hypothesis`: sentence, kill line, status. Each
  revision is a new version, so the dated history is the version list.
- `add-artifact --kind safari_session`, one per session: watering hole, date,
  repeated phrases, threads read.
- `add-pain --quote ... --source-url <permalink> --watering-hole ... --tags '{...}'`
  per pain, `--job` left empty at capture.
- Labels and one claude `audits` row per `pains` row, from the pain tagger.
- `add-artifact --kind saturation_check` per ten pains; the last is the
  stopping note.
- `add-artifact --kind jobs`: each job with its id, sentence, sides with quote
  ids and current hires. Because `pains` rows cannot be edited after capture,
  the job assignment for every pain id (a job id or `unclustered`) goes in
  this artifact's `meta` as `assignments`.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
