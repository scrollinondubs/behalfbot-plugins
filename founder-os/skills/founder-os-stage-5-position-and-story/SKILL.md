description: FounderOS stage 5 coach, position and story. Helps a founder write the one-sentence job their product is hired for, choose a foothold segment incumbents will not defend, size that small market in people, and rewrite the launch as PR/FAQ v2 from ledger evidence beside the untouched v0. Triggers when a founder at stage 5 asks how to position the product, who exactly it is for, how big the market is, or how to rewrite their pitch, and after a stage 4 pass.

# Stage 5: Position and story

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. From `earlier_artifacts`, read the stage 2 `jobs`, the stage 4
   `sprint_results`, `exit_criteria` and `mvp_scope` (which cluster the tests
   backed), and the stage 1 `audience` with its `bowling_pin`.
3. Read the version 0 PR/FAQ from stage 0 (`latest_prfaq` names the newest
   version; version 0 must still be there unchanged). v2 is written beside it.
4. Read `gate_history`. A failed stage 5 gate names the card and step.

If `current_stage` is not 5, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 5 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `job-and-foothold`, `small-market-first` and `prfaq-v2`, plus
the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

Content, channels, sales pages and outreach come later. If the founder wants to
start publishing, say the story has to be right first.

## Procedure

1. **`job-and-foothold`, steps 1 and 2.** Write the [[job-to-be-done]] as one
   sentence from the stage 2 cluster the stage 4 test backed hardest, then list
   today's fixes, doing nothing included.
2. **`job-and-foothold`, steps 3 to 6.** Pick the fork, test whether each
   incumbent would defend the segment, name the [[foothold]] against the stage
   1 pin, and write what it is not for. If the fork is not placed by real rows,
   send the founder to run interviews in the segment: at least five
   `interviews` rows must match the foothold. Fieldwork.
3. **`small-market-first`, steps 1 to 4.** Count the market in people with a
   source, check they cluster in reachable channels, table who serves them
   today, and set a target share with reasoning. The headcount often needs
   fieldwork in a directory or member list.
4. **`small-market-first`, steps 5 to 7.** Both size-lie checks on the market
   sentence, the expansion sequence, the durability line.
5. **`prfaq-v2`, steps 1 to 5.** Gather the inputs, rewrite headline and opener
   from the job and foothold, replace every invented quote with a ledger quote
   and its interview id, rebuild the external FAQ from logged objections, and
   put a status on every internal FAQ answer. At least one stays assumed.
6. **`prfaq-v2`, steps 6 and 7.** Write the diff against v0, then save v2 as a
   new PR/FAQ row. Never touch v0; there is no call that edits it, and the gate
   checks it is unchanged.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. If `ready` is false, `missing` says
   what is short. Tell the founder, go back to the card that produces it, and
   do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the rows. Resolve every quote in v2
   to an `interviews` id yourself. One audits row per check against the
   submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. **A fail needs no sign-off.** `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision fail --rationale "<checks, ids, card and step>"`.
   It stays in stage 5 by default. If the stage 4 tests backed no cluster
   clearly, fail with `--routes-to 4`.
4. **A pass needs Sean.** Write a recommendation citing every artifact, both
   PR/FAQ rows and the interviews behind the fork, plus any borderline. Hand
   over and stop. Sean records his sign-off himself with
   `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR=1 stage.py signoff --founder-id <id> --verdict pass|fail --findings "..."`.
   This skill never sets `FOUNDER_OS_OPERATOR`, never runs `signoff` and never
   runs `record_audit.py --auditor sean`. `decide --decision pass` is refused
   until Sean's sign-off is on the submission.

A market claim with no counted people behind it is a guess:
[[evidence-not-self-report]].

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind job_statement`: the sentence, its stage 2 cluster, the
  ids of at least five `pains` rows with that job and the stage 4 result.
- `add-artifact --kind foothold`: segment, fork, current fixes, incumbent
  table, and the `pains` or `interviews` ids that place it on the fork.
- `add-interview` for new conversations in the foothold segment, `--segment`
  set to the foothold.
- `add-artifact --kind not_for`, `--kind market_sizing`,
  `--kind expansion_sequence`.
- `add-prfaq --assumptions '[...]'`: the v2 rewrite, a new row beside v0, with
  quote references to interview ids in the body and a status on every
  assumption.
- `add-artifact --kind prfaq_diff`: died, confirmed and still open against v0,
  plus anything new.
- `submit`, the check rulings, then `decide`. Never `record_gate_decision`
  directly, and never Sean's rows.
