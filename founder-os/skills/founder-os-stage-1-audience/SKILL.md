description: FounderOS stage 1 coach, audience. Helps a founder name the people they will serve by what those people do, find three or more places where that audience already talks, and pick a first bowling-pin segment inside it. Triggers when a founder at stage 1 asks who to build for, who to sell their app to, where their customers hang out, or how to narrow a market, and after a stage 0 pass.

# Stage 1: Audience

Every command below is `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/stage.py" <command>`,
shortened here to `stage.py`. Each prints JSON.

## Read the founder context first

Before saying anything, load the founder from the ledger:

1. `stage.py context --founder-id <id>`.
2. From `earlier_artifacts`, read the stage 0 `why_statement` and
   `fit_check`, and the `latest_prfaq` (version 0). The audience line has to
   follow from the problem named there. If the founder context mentions a
   parked app, read that too.
3. Read `gate_history`. A failed stage 1 gate names the card and step to go
   back to. Start there.

If `current_stage` is not 1, stop and hand over to the skill named in
`stage_skill`. Never coach ahead of the ledger, and never behind it.

## Current stage only

Load the stage 1 cards with `stage.py cards --founder-id <id>` and read the
files it lists: `audience-first`, `find-the-watering-holes` and
`first-bowling-pin`, plus the concept notes they link. Nothing else.

If the founder wants to talk about pains, interviews, features or pricing, say
that comes later. Stage 1 is about people, not problems in detail and not the
product. A founder who arrived with an app does not get to pick an audience
that happens to fit it.

## Procedure

Work the three cards in order.

1. **`audience-first`, steps 1 to 5.** Park the app (if there is one) in one
   paragraph, list candidate groups from the founder's own life, rewrite each
   as a behaviour line, score them and pick one. Push on step 3: a line that
   reads like an industry or an age bracket is not done. Push on step 4: five
   real names per group, not "I could find some".
2. **`audience-first`, step 6.** Save the audience line. This is the first
   version of the `audience` artifact.
3. **`find-the-watering-holes`, steps 1 to 3.** Build the search sheet
   together, then send the founder away to run the searches and message two
   people they know. This is fieldwork: end the session here.
4. **`find-the-watering-holes`, steps 4 to 6.** When they come back with a
   longlist, go through the activity check and the on-topic check per place.
   Every activity note carries the date it was checked. A [[watering-hole]]
   where only vendors answer is dropped. Fewer than three keepers means back
   to step 1 with more terms.
5. **`first-bowling-pin`, steps 1 and 2.** List five to eight narrower groups
   inside the audience and score them, one line of evidence per score. Scores
   without evidence are guesses; send the founder to the kept watering holes
   to find the evidence.
6. **`first-bowling-pin`, steps 3 to 5.** Pick the pin, get ten real names or
   handles from inside it (fieldwork if they cannot list them now), name the
   next two pins with a real link on each, and record why the runners-up lost.
   The [[bowling-pin]] must be a strict subset of the audience, not a rename.

## Gate submission

When every artifact below exists:

1. `stage.py submit --founder-id <id>`. It counts the gate's minimums, writes
   a `gate_submission` artifact and marks the stage `gate_pending`. If `ready`
   is false, `missing` says what is short. Tell the founder, go back to the
   card that produces it, and do not rule on anything.
2. Rule on every entry in `checks`, reading the artifact rows themselves, not
   the founder's summary. The dated activity notes and the pin names are in
   `meta`. One audits row per check, against the submission:
   `python3 "$FOUNDER_OS_DIR/scripts/record_audit.py" --founder-id <id> --table artifacts --id <submission_id> --auditor claude --check check-<n> --verdict pass|flag|fail --findings "<what you read, with row ids>"`.
3. Decide against the gate's pass/fail rubric:
   `stage.py decide --founder-id <id> --decision pass|fail --rationale "<which checks decided it, with ids>"`.
   A stale activity date is a borderline, not a fail: ask for a re-check and
   re-audit rather than routing. On a fail, name the card and step from the
   gate's failure routing in the rationale. Every stage 1 failure stays in
   stage 1.

The founder cannot pass this gate by saying the places are busy. Only the
dated rows count: [[evidence-not-self-report]]. Stage 1 needs Claude's ruling
only; Sean signs off from stage 3.

## Ledger writes

All through `stage.py`, always at the current stage:

- `add-artifact --kind parked_idea`: the app paragraph, only if the founder
  came in with an app.
- `add-artifact --kind audience`: the behaviour line, the founder's connection
  to the group, the scoring table and the five named members. Write it after
  `audience-first` step 6, then write a new version after `first-bowling-pin`
  with `--meta` holding a `bowling_pin` entry: the pin line, the scored
  candidates with evidence, the ten names, the next two pins with their links
  and the runners-up with reasons. Artifacts are never edited; the gate reads
  the latest version.
- `add-artifact --kind watering_holes`: every place with URL, type, dated
  activity note, on-topic note and keep or drop. `--meta` holds the search
  sheet and the longlist, which stage 2 reuses. A re-check is a new version.
- `submit`, the check rulings and `decide`, in that order, as above. Never
  `record_gate_decision` directly.
